        <h2>Construction Contract</h2>
        <p>
          A contractor is a skilled person (or organisation) who provides
          services for other parties. Often, individual contractors are
          self-employed and run their own business. If an organisation hires
          a contractor, they hire the contractor as an external worker,
          rather than as an employee, for a set time (or project).
